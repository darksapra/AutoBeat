# Spadd

This app allows the user to automatically add tracks to a specific playlsit, wheather it is selected manually through custom mode, or playing through spotify. I requires authentication from user to log in and use it. 

The implementation is pretty basic, but works pretty well, making use of the available [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/). It is recommended, on android, to have the [Spotify App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spotify.music&gl=US) installed on the device for music control.

It doesn't have playback support.

## How can I use it?

It is a PWA app, allowing the app to be installed on the diferent devices by just entering to the live and running online version, at[spotify-auto-add.web.app](https://spotify-auto-add.web.app/).

On the [Releases](https://github.com/darksapra/auto-adder-spotify/releases) section there is available an android apk. Please, if using it from an Android, download and install it so that the app works accordingly.
